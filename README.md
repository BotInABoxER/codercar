From [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3334545](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3334545)

Powered by a Raspberry Pi Zero W, Project Rover is a [DietPi](https://dietpi.com/)-compatible educational robotics kit that is modular, Wifi-enabled, works with Node-RED, and includes a lid with holes for M3 and M2.5 screws that can be used to mount any manner of sensors, servos, and electronics.

Project Rover now has its own documentation website, so check it out at [https://projectrover.botinabox.ca](https://projectrover.botinabox.ca) for more information, including printing, assembly, and programming instructions.

# BOM/Tools:

You will likely need the following parts to get the absolute most out of this kit:

-[A Raspberry Pi Zero W with soldered male headers](https://ebay.to/2vXeEi7)

The following tools/things may also come in handy:

-[A set of Allen Keys](https://ebay.to/2W1emFk) or a [Screwdriver Set](https://ebay.to/2VocQJd)

-[Mini Wire Strippers](https://ebay.to/30r4STo)

-[microSD Card Reader](https://ebay.to/2Q2rFA9)

-[Raspberry Pi Power Adapter](https://ebay.to/2JpZOcL)

And, if you want to take the Raspberry Pi Zero W out of its case and use it as a mini desktop computer (it's not really meant for that, but don't let that stop you), you might need these things:

-[Mini HDMI to HDMI Adapter](https://ebay.to/2HoKPw9)

-[HDMI Cable](https://ebay.to/30jvTIo)

-[USB OTG HUB](https://ebay.to/2vZmk3g)

Finally, if you want to just use the Pi Zero W with an older TV monitor that doesn't support HDMI, you could try some of these (though only the ones that work with your particular setup):

-[HDMI to RCA Converter](https://ebay.to/2VtEIM8)

-[RCA Cable](https://ebay.to/2VA7JdG)

-[HDMI to DVI Cable](https://ebay.to/2YyydcR)

-[HDMI to VGA Converter](https://ebay.to/2vYdJ0U)

-[VGA Cable](https://ebay.to/2HrOYiI)

-[RF Modulator](https://ebay.to/2VmkbJ3)

Thank you fellow makers! If anybody that made these things sees this page, email me at [matthew@botinabox.ca](mailto:matthew@botinabox.ca) and I'll add your GitHub username or a link of your choosing to this list.

# List of Files

This kit comes in three versions: the Deci, the Deka, and the Hecto.

In the STL folder, you will find a folder with the latest version of STL files available inside.

In v0.5.3:

## Deci

- Body

- Top Mount

- Battery Bank Box

- Battery Bank Box Lid

- Wheel (x4)

- Wheel Shaft Tester (print this first to test the tolerances. If it fits onto the motor's axle (don't force it) without falling out easily or being so tight you can't pull it off, you can print the Wheel without concern. However, if it doesn't fit, you will need to edit the Wheel file to adjust it (if you need help with this, e-mail me at [matthew@botinabox.ca](mailto:matthew@botinabox.ca).))

## Deka

All of the **Deci** parts above, plus:

- Arduino Nano Mount

- Breadboard Mount

- Breadboard Mount Bumper (x2)

- Front Mount

- Mini Mount

- Ultrasonic Sensor Mount

## Hecto

All of the **Deka** parts above, plus:

- Another Mini Mount

- Another Top Mount

- LED Matrix Mount

- Nokia 5110 LCD Mount


# Coming Soon

Project Rover is currently in full-time, active developmnet, so expect things to change. Soon to come:

- CMOS Camera Mount

- Wiring Tutorial

- Programming Tutorial

- Custom DietPi Image (with pre-installed software)

At any rate, I hope you get some enjoyment out of this crazy kit, and that it maybe helps you learn something about building 3D-printed cars. If you have any questions, email me at [matthew@botinabox.ca](mailto:matthew@botinabox.ca), and if you have any suggestions for changes, please make a pull request.

Sincerely, Matthew Piercey
